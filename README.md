# Angel.co Startup Parser
> A project that contains two cli tool for fetchting startup datas from ancel.co
> and converts to csv files

* `angel.rb`: This CLI fetches startup datas from angel.co by given market tag
  and creates a SQLite database.
* `sqlite_to_csv_converter.rb`: This CLI creates two csv file (nodes.csv,
  edges.csv) with fetched data by `angel.rb` for use in
  [https://graphcommons.com](GraphCommons).

**Current Status: angel.co is not exposing it's api, so these tools have lost
their functionality.**

## Features
* Custom database views

## Motivation
The motivation of this project came from PhD AslÄ± Boyraz Yazagan, a lecturer at
Rize University. She asked me to develop these tools to use in academic
conference (ICITS - [http://www.icits.org/](International Conference on
Information Technology and Science)). We used these tools to pull startups
operating in the internet of things market, other markets they are related to,
and their locations and convert them into a graph. You can see the result of the
study below:

* Ruby >= 2.2.x
* Bundler(`gem install bundler`)
* See also [Gemfile](Gemfile)

## Usage
### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
$ bundler install
```
### 2. Configure
First of all, rename the following files:

* `config.example.yml` => `config.yml`
* `views.example.yml` => `views.yml` (*optional, if you want add a new database
  view(s)*)

and edit those files by yourself.

### Create database
Run `ruby angel.rb -m "[Market Tag]"` or just `ruby angel.rb` command, and then
follow the steps.
